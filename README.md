# iota

iota is a Python framework to interact with BMW's ConnectedDrive service. It focuses specifically on "i" vehicles, most especially the i3. Feel free to fork and submit pull requests to better support other models.

This is primarily Python 3.x code; it may run under Python 2.x but I make no guarantees. Pull requests to add Python 2.x support are also welcome.

Credit is due to Terence Eden; none of his code is used here but he inspired my original efforts to reverse-engineer the API. You can also find [his repo on GitHub](https://github.com/edent/BMW-i-Remote).

### Why the name? ###

It's the Greek letter for "i" and that's it.
